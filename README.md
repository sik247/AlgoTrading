# Part 1 Equal-Weight S&P 500 Index Fund

## Overview

This Jupyter notebook, titled "Equal-Weight S&P 500 Index Fund," is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the equal-weighting strategy applied to the S&P 500 index. The primary objective is to create a balanced and diversified portfolio by allocating equal capital to each constituent stock in the S&P 500.

1. **Introduction to Equal-Weighting:**
   - Equal-weighting is an investment strategy that involves allocating the same amount of capital to each stock in the S&P 500 index.
   - Rationale: Equal-weighting aims to provide a more balanced and diversified portfolio compared to traditional market capitalization-weighting.

2. **Implementation:**
   - Code implementation for equal-weighting the S&P 500 index using Python and relevant libraries.
   - Steps to calculate and rebalance the portfolio for equal capital allocation.

3. **Performance Analysis:**
   - Evaluation of the performance of the equal-weighted portfolio.
   - Comparison with traditional market capitalization-weighted portfolios for key performance metrics.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Summary of findings and insights from implementing the equal-weighting strategy.
   - Considerations for investors looking to adopt an equal-weighting approach in their portfolios.

## Usage

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Open the Jupyter notebook using a compatible environment.
- Execute the cells in sequential order to understand and analyze the equal-weighting strategy.

# Part 3 - Simple Moving Average 

## Overview

This Jupyter notebook is focused on implementing and analyzing a Simple Moving Average (SMA) strategy. The strategy utilizes SMA as a technical indicator to make trading decisions for optimizing returns.

1. **Introduction to Simple Moving Average (SMA):**
   - Simple Moving Average (SMA) is a widely used technical indicator that calculates the average price of a security over a specified time period.
   - Rationale: SMA is employed to identify trends, make trading decisions, and smooth out price fluctuations.

2. **Implementation:**
   - Code implementation for the Simple Moving Average strategy using Python and relevant libraries.
   - Explanation of parameters, time periods, and considerations for SMA.

3. **Performance Analysis:**
   - Evaluation of the strategy's performance using historical data.
   - Comparison with other strategies and considerations for real-world application.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Summary of findings and insights from implementing the Simple Moving Average strategy.
   - Potential enhancements and future directions for incorporating SMA into broader trading strategies.

## Usage

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Open the Jupyter notebook using a compatible environment.
- Execute the cells in sequential order to understand, implement, and analyze the Simple Moving Average strategy.
